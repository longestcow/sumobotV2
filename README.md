# sumobot V2    
this is my second attempt at the robot rumble competition  
i went with the classic short and low center of mass build to have an actual shot, and got decently far (ranked 6 or something)  
i wrote the code within an hour, so it's very basic but it got me through  
the idea initially was to have 3 ToF distance sensors, but i found out later (after all the painful soldering) that one single sensor object in the code
takes up too big of a chunk, thus only allowing me to have 2 of those sensors at max without the nano overflowing  
a bit later, the 2 sensors stopped working together (they worked individually though) so i ended up with only using the one in the center
i had this entire strategy to have a bunch of starting sequences based on how close i position my hand in front of the sensor on power, but ended up only having 2  
one was to simply turn towards the opponent and immediately ram into them (the starting position was known and constant) and the other was to move backward in an attempt 
to escape the opponent who was using the first opening  
i pretty much only really used the first opening though as it worked very consistently  
heres a few clips of my wins and losses
